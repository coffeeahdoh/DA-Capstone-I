# DA-Capstone-I
FY2019 planning for the fictional rental car company Lariat

This capstone project involves analyzing rental car data (inc. car information, monthly costs, rental performance, business KPI). Excel was used to (1) analyze costs, revenue, & profit; (2) create a model for executives to pull individual car information regarding costs, insurance, revenue, and profit; and (3) create a model that provides possible scenarios in which the company can increase profit while reducing costs. A presentation was prepared via PowerPoint
