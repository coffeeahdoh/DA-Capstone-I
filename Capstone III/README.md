●	Analysis of stress-related messages and their relation to COVID-19 based on the Stress Annotated Dataset.
●	Various inferential statistical tests to determine any differences in overall stress and multiple factors before and after the start of the pandemic.
●	Tools: Python, Excel, PowerPoint
●	Statistics: Pearson’s Correlation, Student’s t-test, Bartlett’s test for co-variance, Kruskal-Wallis & post-hoc Dunn, and ANOVA & post-hoc Tukey HSD

The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a drastic change in the workforce worldwide. At least in the U.S., all sectors of the workforce experienced changes in the work environment, whether that change was working at home, reduction in employees, or changes in protocols. Dramatic changes in any sense could therefore lead to stress and responses to stress are highly individual. 

To gain insight on the differences between COVID-related and -unrelated stress, I used the stress severity scores from the Stress Annotated Dataset (SAD). The dataset was created by Mauriello et al. (2021)* and represents a dataset of messages from social media and chatbots. Each message was given a stressor label (financial problem, family issues, work, school, etc.) and a severity score. Using these scores and various inferential statistics tests, I sought to see if there were any differences in severity scores between COVID-related and -unrelated stress overall and also between the stressors.
